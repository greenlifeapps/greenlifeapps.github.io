YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THERE ARE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH USING AN INTERNET-BASED MARKETPLACE AND INTERACTING WITH OTHER USERS IN PERSON AS OUTLINED IN SECTION 17.

If there is a conflict between these Terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict.

We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will provide you with notice of such changes, such as by sending an email, providing a notice through our Services or updating the date at the top of these Terms. Unless we say otherwise in our notice, the amended Terms will be effective immediately, and your continued use of our Services after we provide such notice will confirm your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you must stop using our Services.

4. The GreenLife Apps Services

A. Posting Items
The GreenLife Apps Services allow you to post items for sale by uploading pictures and providing item descriptions. You can post most items through the Services without charge. GreenLife Apps charges a fee to post some items or if you exceed your available free posts for certain types of items. If there is a fee to post your item, GreenLife Apps will notify you through the Services before you post your item. You may also promote your items for a fee. If you pay to promote your item, GreenLife Apps will post your item more prominently and frequently within the Services home feed. Promoted items are also identified within the feed. GreenLife Apps offers various pricing packages, including subscriptions, to post and promote items. Pricing details are provided through the GreenLife Apps Services.

B. Trading, swapping, lending or borrowing
When two parties are interested in an exchange for an item posted for sale on the Services, they have different options for completing the transaction.

If a buyer and seller agree, items may be paid for outside of the GreenLife Apps Services, such as by cash, check or other payment method agreed upon. Such payments are made directly between the buyer and the seller when they complete their transaction, pursuant to terms they determine. GreenLife Apps is not a party to such transactions, does not facilitate such transactions, and cannot assist with refunds or returns related to such transactions in any manner.

Alternatively, the GreenLife Apps Services allow you to pay for a purchase with a credit card or other electronic payment method through the Services ("GreenLife Apps Payment Solution"). Some transactions, such as purchases from Pro Sellers, may only be made using the GreenLife Apps Payment Solution. All purchases made using the GreenLife Apps Payment Solution are made directly between you and the other party according to these Terms and any other terms the parties mutually determine. GreenLife Apps is not a party to such transactions and disclaims any and all responsibility to facilitate such transactions or provide refunds or returns, other than as expressly provided in the Purchase Protection Policies.

GreenLife Apps is not a party to transactions conducted between the interested parties, or to the shipping of items from one party to the other. GreenLife Apps is not liable for any losses, damages, or delays related to the transaction.

Anyone who ships a prohibited, illegal, or improperly packaged or labeled material is subject to legal penalties such as civil penalties, fines and/or imprisonment, including but not limited to those specified in 18 U.S.C. § 1716 and 39 U.S.C. § 3018.

16. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, GreenLife Apps and the other GreenLife Apps Parties will not be liable to you under any theory of liability—whether based in contract, tort, negligence, warranty, or otherwise—for any indirect, consequential, incidental, or special damages or lost profits, even if GreenLife Apps or the other GreenLife Apps Parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

The total liability of GreenLife Apps and the other GreenLife Apps Parties for any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services, regardless of the form of the action, is limited to the greater of $100 or the amount paid by you to GreenLife Apps in the 12 months preceding the event that gave rise to the claim.

The limitations set forth in this Section 16 will not limit or exclude liability for the gross negligence, fraud or intentional misconduct of GreenLife Apps or the other GreenLife Apps Parties or for any other matters in which liability cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law. Additionally, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.

17. Assumption of Risk
A. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THERE ARE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH UTILIZING AN INTERNET-BASED MARKETPLACE AND INTERACTING WITH OTHER USERS IN PERSON. WE DO NOT INVESTIGATE OR VERIFY ANY USER'S REPUTATION, CONDUCT, MORALITY, CRIMINAL BACKGROUND, OR ANY INFORMATION USERS MAY SUBMIT TO THE SERVICES (OTHER THAN IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRUYOU FEATURE DESCRIBED IN SECTION 5). YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING ALL NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS WHEN INTERACTING WITH OTHER USERS, PARTICULARLY WHEN MEETING A STRANGER IN PERSON FOR THE FIRST TIME. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OTHER USERS MAY ATTEMPT TO PHYSICALLY HARM OR DEFRAUD YOU OR OBTAIN INFORMATION FROM YOU FOR FRAUDULENT PURPOSES. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR, AND ASSUME ALL RISKS RELATED TO, SELLING AND BUYING THROUGH GreenLife Apps'S SERVICES (INCLUDING ALL ONLINE AND OFFLINE INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER USERS).

B. COMMUNITY MEETUP SPOTS. COMMUNITY MEETUP SPOTS ARE LOCATIONS IN WHICH A THIRD PARTY (SUCH AS A POLICE DEPARTMENT OR LOCAL STORE) HAS AGREED TO POST A COMMUNITY MEETUP SPOT SIGN. WE ENCOURAGE THIRD PARTIES TO PLACE COMMUNITY MEETUP SPOTS IN WELL-LIT LOCATIONS, WITH SURVEILLANCE AND IN GENERALLY WELL-TRAFFICKED AREAS; HOWEVER, GreenLife Apps DOES NOT INDEPENDENTLY VERIFY THE CONDITIONS AT ANY COMMUNITY MEETUP SPOT, DOES NOT MONITOR COMMUNITY MEETUP SPOTS AND DOES NOT WARRANT THEIR SAFETY OR CONDITION. YOUR USAGE OF COMMUNITY MEETUP SPOTS, AND ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF THAT USAGE, INCLUDING AGAINST ANY THIRD PARTY POSTING A COMMUNITY MEETUP SPOT SIGN, REMAINS SUBJECT TO THE EXPRESS PROVISIONS IN SECTIONS 15-18 OF THESE TERMS.

18. Release
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you release GreenLife Apps and the other GreenLife Apps Parties from responsibility, liability, claims, demands and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including, but not limited to, claims of negligence), arising out of or related to disputes between users and the acts or omissions of third parties. If you are a consumer who resides in California, you hereby waive your rights under California Civil Code § 1542, which provides: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor."

19. Transfer and Processing Data
In order for us to provide our Services, you agree that we may process, transfer and store information about you in the United States and other countries, where you may not have the same rights and protections as you do under local law.

20. Guidelines for Law Enforcement Agency
If you are a law enforcement agency, we may work with you to assist in on-going matters related to alleged violations of the law, please visit this page for more information.

21. Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration
Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with GreenLife Apps and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration agreement. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.

No Representative Actions. You and GreenLife Apps agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and GreenLife Apps, and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. The limitations imposed by this section apply to, but are in no way limited to, class action refund claims brought by a class of taxpayers against GreenLife Apps related to taxes collected and remitted in good faith efforts at compliance with state and local marketplace facilitator or marketplace provider laws. Nothing in this section will be construed to prohibit a buyer from filing a refund claim with the seller or applicable state and local tax authority as permitted by law.

Arbitration of Disputes. Except for small claims disputes in which you or GreenLife Apps seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or GreenLife Apps seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and GreenLife Apps waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services resolved in court. Instead, for any dispute or claim that you have against GreenLife Apps or relating in any way to the Services, you agree to first contact GreenLife Apps and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim ("Notice") to GreenLife Apps by email at legal_department@GreenLifeApps.com or by certified mail addressed to GreenLife Apps.

The Notice must (a) include your name, your residence address, your email address, your telephone number, and, if you have registered for an GreenLife Apps account, the email address your account is registered under if it is different from your current email address; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and GreenLife Apps cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in California unless you are a consumer, in which case you may elect to hold the arbitration at the JAMS office closest to your residence. For purposes of this Section 21, a "consumer" means a person using the Services for personal, family or household purposes. Additionally, arbitrations may be conducted telephonically or via video conference for disputes alleging damages less than $10,000. You and GreenLife Apps agree that arbitrations will be held in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("JAMS Rules"). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the JAMS website and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

You and GreenLife Apps agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 21 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the "FAA"), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine whether a dispute may be arbitrated. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual's claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute. The arbitrator, GreenLife Apps, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.

You and GreenLife Apps agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and GreenLife Apps will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by GreenLife Apps, GreenLife Apps will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and GreenLife Apps agree that the state or federal courts of the State of California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.

Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and GreenLife Apps will not have the right to assert the claim.

You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 21 by emailing GreenLife Apps at legal_department@GreenLifeApps.com.

In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with Section 23.

If any portion of this Section 21 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 21 or the parties' ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 21; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 21 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 21 will be enforceable. If you are a consumer, the provisions of this Section 21 will be modified to the extent necessary to conform to the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards.


22. Governing Law and Venue
Any dispute arising from these Terms and your use of the Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of California, except to the extent preempted by U.S. federal law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of California.

24. Modifying and Terminating our Services
We reserve the right to modify our Services or to suspend or stop providing all or portions of our Services at any time. You also have the right to stop using our Services at any time. We are not responsible for any loss or harm related to your inability to access or use our Services.

25. Miscellaneous
If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

The failure of GreenLife Apps to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity. You agree that communications and transactions between us may be conducted electronically. GreenLife Apps is an independent contractor for all purposes and is not your agent or trustee. You are not an agent of GreenLife Apps.
